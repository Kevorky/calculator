# Calculator

This is a simple calculator app. It will hold at most 2 numbers in memory. So if user tries to chain multiple operations, then the earlier result will be calculated before proceeding.

For example, if user clicks '6 * 5 + 8', when user clicks '+' the system will automatically calculate the first part. So it will be '30 + 8' and so on.
